# Intro to Object Oriented Programming in Ruby

## Objectives

- Define `object` in programming
- Create and instantiate Ruby Classes
  - instance methods
  - class methods (`self`)
  - attribute readers and writers
- Explain scope in the context of Ruby classes

## Questions

- attr_reader/ writer vs attr_accessor?

## Notes

OOP - language design pattern
  - seeks to represent ideas and things as objects

Object

- attributes: data describing the object
- methods: actions that the object can perform

Classes
- instance
  - instance variables: data specefic to a particular object or instance created by a class
  - instance methods: functionality available to instances of the class
- class
  - class variables
  - class methods

attr_reader - allows attribute to be read
attr_writer - allows attribute to be written
attr_accessor - allows attribute to be both read and written

macro - method that defines other methods
