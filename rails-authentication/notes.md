# Rails Authentication and Authorization

## Objectives

- define authentication and authorization
- discuss encryption and hashing
- implement auth in Rails

## Question

- user - listing - owner - item

Authentication vs Authorization

Authentication

- are you who you say you are?
  - username and password
  - OAuth - authenticating through a third party application (facebook, Google)
  - 2 factor - secondary authentication after user/pass

Authorization

- as an authenticated user what are you allowed to do / what do you have access to
  - admin users might have greater access or permissions than regular users

Auth

- general term describing both

Hashing

- scrambling algorithm that converts a string to an anonymous random string
- not reversible

hash("hello") = "alskdf09a8sdfy983745rqwkldjfy9787435h"
hash("helloo") = "fj;alskfd90345rtl;skjfdgs8df"

Encryption

- reversible
