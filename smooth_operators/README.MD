# SMOOTH OPERATORS LECTURE

# ASSUMPTIONS
* Concepts covered speak directly to Ruby code, but can be utilized in many other programming languages
* Bitwise operators are out of scope for this talk
* Not a 100% comprehensive overview (if you are interested to learn more, see links below!)

## SWBATs

[ x ] Define the terms operator, operand, and arity
[ x ] List the three basic types of operators and give examples of each
[ x ] Demonstrate how different operator types can be utilized


## Terminology

* Operator - A function that acts on elements of a space to produce elements of another space.
* Operand - The value on which an operation is being performed on.
* Arity - The number of operands an operator acts on.
